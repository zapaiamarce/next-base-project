## Styled

Use of styled-components is strongly recommended for styling in general. The general rule would be: **For every component a "styled components" module will be created with the same name and a .styled.tsx ending**. For example, in the case of an **index.tsx** file, all the styled components needed from this component will be placed on **styled.tsx** in the same directory and, in the case of a **example.tsx** component, weÂ´ll have an **example.styled.tsx** file with this particular module styled components.

Eg.:

- component-dir
    - index.tsx
    - styled.tsx
    - another-subcomponent.tsx
    - another-subcomponent.styled.tsx
